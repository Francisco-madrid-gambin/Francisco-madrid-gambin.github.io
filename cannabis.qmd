# Metabolomics of Cannabis Use and Acute Intoxication

## Understanding the Biological Signature of the Ayahuasca Experience

Cannabis is often perceived as a “soft drug”. However, acute intoxication is an increasingly common reason for emergency department visits — particularly with the rise of high-potency THC products, edibles and synthetic derivatives.

This project examines the clinical, biochemical and epidemiological features of acute cannabis intoxication in real-world healthcare settings, with the goal of understanding:

-   Who is most at risk
-   What biological systems are most affected
-   How clinical severity can be anticipated
-   What this tells us about cannabis as a pharmacological agent

Rather than focusing on social debate, this work approaches cannabis intoxication as a biomedical phenomenon.

Our 2025 study, published in *nature neuropsychopharmacology*, investigates these issues.

## Why This Matters

Emergency departments are reporting increasing cases of:

-   Acute anxiety and panic reactions
-   Transient psychotic episodes
-   Cardiovascular symptoms (tachycardia, hypertension)
-   Altered consciousness
-   Accidental pediatric exposure
-   Poly-substance interactions

While most cases resolve without long-term consequences, some presentations mimic severe neurological or psychiatric disorders. Understanding the physiological signatures of intoxication helps clinicians differentiate between benign acute reactions and serious pathology.
