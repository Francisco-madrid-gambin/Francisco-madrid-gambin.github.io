# Psychedelic Integromics Research

## Understanding the Biological Signature of the Ayahuasca Experience

Psychedelics are experiencing a scientific renaissance. While clinical trials suggest therapeutic potential in depression, PTSD and addiction, the biological mechanisms underlying their effects in humans remain largely unknown.

This project investigates one central question:

> What happens in the human metabolome during a psychedelic experience?

Our 2022 study, published in *Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy* :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index="2"}, represents the **first report describing the impact of a psychedelic (ayahuasca) on the human metabolome**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Ayahuasca?

Ayahuasca is a traditional Amazonian brew prepared from:

-   *Banisteriopsis caapi* (β-carbolines: harmine, harmaline, tetrahydroharmine)
-   *Psychotria viridis* (DMT)

DMT activates 5-HT2A receptors, while β-carbolines inhibit monoamine oxidase (MAO), allowing DMT to become orally active.

Although subjective effects are well described, the downstream biochemical cascades triggered by 5-HT2A activation remain poorly understood

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Study Design

We conducted a **within-subject observational study** in 23 healthy participants from the Santo Daime tradition.

-   Plasma samples collected **before and after** ayahuasca intake
-   Targeted metabolomics via **LC–MS/MS**
-   Subjective effects measured with the validated **5-D ASC scale**
-   Integrated network modelling using **regularized canonical correlation analysis (rCCA).**
-   Pathway enrichment using diffusion-based KEGG analysis (FELLA)

This allowed us to connect:

**Metabolites ↔ Alkaloid concentrations ↔ Subjective experience**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Key Biological Findings

### 1️⃣ Endocannabinoid System Modulation

After ayahuasca intake:

-   ↑ N-acyl-ethanolamines (e.g., anandamide, DGLEA)
-   ↓ 2-acyl-glycerols (e.g., 2-AG) :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index="11"}

This indicates a strong modulation of the **endocannabinoid system**, a central regulator of mood, emotion and neuroplasticity.

Interestingly, several endocannabinoids were directly associated with alkaloid concentrations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2️⃣ Large Neutral Amino Acid (LNAA) Imbalance

We observed:

-   ↓ Tyrosine
-   Altered LNAA ratios
-   Changes in tryptophan-related pathways

Why does this matter?

LNAAs compete to cross the blood–brain barrier.\
Changes in their relative concentrations influence:

-   Serotonin synthesis (via tryptophan)
-   Dopamine synthesis (via tyrosine)

This suggests a **neurochemical rebalancing between serotonergic and dopaminergic systems** during the experience.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Linking Biology to Subjective Experience

The integrated network analysis revealed:

-   Strong associations between LNAA balance and 9 of 11 ASC subscales\
-   Positive association of tryptophan/LNAA ratio with experiences of:
    -   Unity
    -   Blissful state
    -   Insightfulness

Remarkably, these metabolic signatures were **only moderately related to plasma DMT concentrations**.

This suggests that:

> The subjective psychedelic experience may be shaped more by systemic metabolic reconfiguration than by drug concentration alone.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Systems-Level Interpretation

Enrichment analysis confirmed dysregulation in pathways involved in:

-   Serotonin synthesis\
-   Dopamine metabolism\
-   Endocannabinoid signalling

Together, the findings support a **crosstalk between peripheral metabolism and central neurotransmission**, revealing a specific metabolic fingerprint underlying the ayahuasca experience.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scientific Rigor & Limitations

-   Naturalistic ceremonial setting
-   Single post-intake timepoint for alkaloids
-   Set and setting effects not experimentally controlled

Despite these limitations, this work provides the first human metabolomic framework for psychedelic research.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why This Matters

Understanding the metabolic architecture of psychedelic states may:

-   Clarify mechanisms of therapeutic action
-   Identify biological markers of treatment response
-   Inform precision psychiatry approaches
-   Reveal systemic biomarkers beyond receptor pharmacology

This project sits at the intersection of:

**Metabolomics · Systems Biology · Psychopharmacology · Translational Psychiatry**
