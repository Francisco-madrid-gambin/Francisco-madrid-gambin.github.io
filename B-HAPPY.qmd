# B-HAPPY

### Urban Pollution, Stress Biology & Maternal–Infant Health

Funded by the *Jove i Emergent* Programme 2024\
Ajuntament de Barcelona

Project: "Estudi de l'efecte de la contaminació urbana sobre la producció d’hormones d'estrès i benestar durant l'embaràs: Impacte en la salut materno-infantil"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Overview

B-HAPPY (Barcelona Hormones And Pregnancy – Pollution & Young Health) is an investigator-led research initiative examining how urban environmental exposure influences stress-related hormonal regulation during pregnancy and its downstream effects on maternal and infant health.

This project is the result of a collaboration between the [**Hospital del Mar Research Institute**](<https://researchmar.net/es_index.html>) (HMRIB-IMIM) and the [**Barcelona Institute for Global Health**](https://www.isglobal.org/en/)(ISGlobal).

Funded through the *Jove i Emergent* programme of the Ajuntament de Barcelona, the project aims to consolidate a new independent research line at the intersection of environmental epidemiology, stress biology and computational biomedicine.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Scientific Rationale

Urban environments expose populations to complex mixtures of:

-   Air pollution
-   Traffic-related emissions
-   Noise
-   Built-environment stressors

Pregnancy represents a biologically sensitive window during which environmental exposures may alter endocrine regulation, inflammatory pathways and metabolic adaptation.

Stress-related hormones — particularly glucocorticoids and associated neuroendocrine mediators — play a central role in:

-   Maternal physiological adaptation
-   Fetal development
-   Long-term neurodevelopmental trajectories

B-HAPPY investigates whether urban pollution contributes to measurable alterations in maternal stress biology and whether these changes are associated with maternal and infant health outcomes.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Research Questions

The project addresses three core questions:

1.  Does exposure to urban pollution correlate with altered maternal stress hormone profiles during pregnancy?\
2.  Are these biological alterations associated with obstetric or neonatal outcomes?\
3.  Can integrative modeling approaches identify vulnerability or resilience patterns within urban populations?

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Methodological Framework

B-HAPPY combines:

-   High-resolution environmental exposure assessment
-   Hormonal profiling during pregnancy
-   Clinical maternal–infant phenotyping
-   Advanced statistical and machine learning models

The analytical framework integrates environmental data with biological measurements using reproducible computational pipelines in R and Python, ensuring methodological transparency and robustness.

Rather than focusing on single biomarkers, the project adopts a systems-level perspective to understand how environmental stressors may influence endocrine regulation during pregnancy.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Innovation

What distinguishes B-HAPPY is the integration of:

-   Environmental epidemiology
-   Endocrine stress biology
-   Translational maternal health research
-   Computational modeling

By bridging environmental exposure data with biological stress markers, the project moves beyond associative epidemiology toward mechanistic insight.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Public Health Relevance

Urban pollution is not evenly distributed across cities.\
Understanding its biological impact during pregnancy has implications for:

-   Maternal health policy
-   Urban planning
-   Preventive public health strategies
-   Early-life health trajectories

B-HAPPY contributes evidence at a critical intersection:\
where environmental design meets biological vulnerability.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Broader Vision

Beyond immediate findings, the project establishes a framework for integrating environmental exposures into precision public health models.

It represents a step toward data-driven urban health research — rigorous, computationally grounded and socially relevant.
