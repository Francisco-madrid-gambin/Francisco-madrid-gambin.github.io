### About

I am a biomedical scientist working at the intersection of computational biology, biomedicine and data science.

My research focuses on metabolomics, multi-omics integration and complex human cohort data, leading biomarker discovery projects in aging, frailty and neurodegeneration. I combine peripheral biochemistry, neuroimaging and machine learning within translational and precision medicine frameworks.

I am developing an emerging research line on psychedelics (psilocybin, ayahuasca, 2-CB) in collaboration with Maastricht University, with published work on ayahuasca integromics.

Beyond building models, I focus on making knowledge transferable — through writing, teaching and video-based scientific communication.

My work sits at the interface of clinical research, data systems design and public-facing science.
