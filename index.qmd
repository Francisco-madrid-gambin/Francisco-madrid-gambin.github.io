### What I do

I am a biomedical scientist working at the intersection of computational biology, biomedicine and data science.

My research focuses on metabolomics, multi-omics integration and complex human cohort data, leading biomarker discovery projects in aging, frailty and neurodegeneration. I combine peripheral biochemistry, neuroimaging and machine learning within translational and precision medicine frameworks.

I am developing an emerging research line on psychedelics (psilocybin, ayahuasca, 2-CB) in collaboration with Maastricht University, with published work on ayahuasca integromics.

Beyond building models, I focus on making knowledge transferable — through writing, teaching and video-based scientific communication.

My work sits at the interface of clinical research, data systems design and public-facing science.

### Scientific Communication & Education

Translating health science and complex biomedical research into accessible narratives — without compromising rigor, and occasionally with a well-placed sense of humor. Accessible educational content through talks, writing and video formats.

### Metabolomics of Cannabis Use and Acute Intoxication

Cannabis is often perceived as a “soft drug”. However, acute intoxication is an increasingly common reason for emergency department visits — particularly with the rise of high-potency THC products, edibles and synthetic derivatives.

This project examines the clinical, biochemical and epidemiological features of acute cannabis intoxication in real-world healthcare settings.

## 🎥 Latest Videos
Scientific rigor doesn’t have to be boring. My work in science communication combines methodological precision with narrative clarity — and a healthy dose of humor — to make complex ideas both accurate and engaging.
