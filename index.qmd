### What I do

I am a biomedical scientist working at the intersection of computational biology, biomedicine and data science.

My research focuses on metabolomics, multi-omics integration and complex human cohort data, leading biomarker discovery projects in aging, frailty and neurodegeneration. I combine peripheral biochemistry, neuroimaging and machine learning within translational and precision medicine frameworks.

I am developing an emerging research line on psychedelics (psilocybin, ayahuasca, 2-CB) in collaboration with Maastricht University, with published work on ayahuasca integromics.

Beyond building models, I focus on making knowledge transferable — through writing, teaching and video-based scientific communication.

My work sits at the interface of clinical research, data systems design and public-facing science.

### Psychedelic Integromics Research

Psychedelics are experiencing a scientific renaissance, suggesting therapeutic potential in depression and PTSD. Yet, the biological mechanisms remain largely unknown. Developing integrative analytical frameworks to study biochemical and neurobiological effects of ayahuasca and related compounds, bridging systems biology and clinical neuroscience. <br>

### Metabolomics of Cannabis Use and Acute Intoxication

Cannabis is often perceived as a “soft drug”. However, acute intoxication is an increasingly common reason for emergency department visits — particularly with the rise of high-potency THC products, edibles and synthetic derivatives.

This project examines the clinical, biochemical and epidemiological features of acute cannabis intoxication in real-world healthcare settings.

## 🎥 Latest Videos

Scientific rigor doesn’t have to be boring. My work in science communication combines methodological precision with narrative clarity — and a healthy dose of humor — to make complex ideas both accurate and engaging.
