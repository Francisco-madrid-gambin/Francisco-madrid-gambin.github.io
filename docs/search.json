    "text": "Understanding the Biological Signature of the Ayahuasca Experience\nPsychedelics are experiencing a scientific renaissance. While clinical trials suggest therapeutic potential in depression, PTSD and addiction, the biological mechanisms underlying their effects in humans remain largely unknown.\nThis project investigates one central question:\n\nWhat happens in the human metabolome during a psychedelic experience?\n\nOur 2022 study, published in Biomedicine & Pharmacotherapy, represents the first report describing the impact of a psychedelic (ayahuasca) on the human metabolome."
